			<h2> Cell Fuel System </h2>
			<span>
				The fuel cell system transforms air and hydrogen into energy,
				two elements that are found abundantly in nature. Beyond the
				electricity generated to power the vehicle, the fuel cell emits
				nothing but <b>water</b>. A High Technology Manufacturer,
				Hextasium is the first automotive company to develop a fuel cell
				offering exceptional performances in a high-end vehicle.
			</span>
			<p>
				However, the system for efficiently and rapidly extracting
				hydrogen from nature is highly polluting. For to date, 95% of
				hydrogen is still produced by fossil fuels, because the cleanest
				system, depending on the source of the electrivity, is
				electrolysis, which is expensive and highly inefficient.{" "}
